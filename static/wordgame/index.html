      <br><br>
      There are two players. Player 1 writes a letter. Player 2 then writes a letter
      either side of this letter. The game continues with each player placing a letter on his turn.
      Neither player is allowed to form a word with the letters
      they write. However, each player must always be able to form a word by writing
      letters either side of the letters already placed.
      <br><br>
      If after Player 2's turn, Player 1 believes that Player 2 cannot form a word
      by placing letters either side of the letters already placed, Player 1 can challenge
      Player 2. If Player 2 can form a word, play continues. Otherwise, Player 1 wins.
      <br>
      Vice versa applies for Player 2 challenging Player 1.
      <br><br>
      If after Player 2's turn, Player 1 believes that Player 2 has formed a word
      with the letter Player 2 just placed, Player 1 can challenge Player 2. If Player 2
      hasn't formed a word, play continues. Otherwise, Player 1 wins.
      <br>
      Vice versa applies for Player 2 challenging Player 1.
